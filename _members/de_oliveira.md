description: "Saulo earned his PhD in 2016 from the University of Oxford, where he worked with Prof. Charlotte Deane developing methods for protein structure prediction. After finishing his doctorate, he worked as a postdoc at Oxford for 2 years, focusing on protein contact prediction and coevolution. He joined the lab in 2018 as a joint postdoctoral scholar with Dr. Henry van den Bedem. His current research focuses on using computational methods to understand protein structures and dynamics and how these relate to experimentally derived electron densities."
