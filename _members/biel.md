description: "Justin graduated from Oregon State University with a degree in Biochemistry and Biophysics. He conducted research in both the laboratories of [Dr. Elisar Barbar](https://barbar.science.oregonstate.edu) studying dynein protein interactions, and [Dr. P. Andrew Karplus](https://biochem.oregonstate.edu/content/p-andrew-karplus) conducting structural bioinformatic research on protein structural components from ultra-high resolution protein crystal structures.


As a [Biophysics](https://biophysics.ucsf.edu) graduate student in the Fraser lab, Justin examined how conformational heterogeneity changed during directed evolution and revealed minor states that resulted from ligand binding. He was supported by a graduate fellowship from [NSF](http://www.nsfgrfp.org/).


As a staff scientist, Justin is now building up capabilities for high-throughput ligand soaking experiments."
