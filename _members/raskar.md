description: "Tushar recently graduated from Department of Chemistry, Universität Hamburg. His research project was carried out in the laboratories of [Dr. Arwen Pearson](https://www1.physik.uni-hamburg.de/en/inf/ag-pearson/personen/pearson-arwen.html) (Center for Free-Electron Laser Science) and [Dr. Trevor Forsyth](https://www.keele.ac.uk/scps/ourpeople/physicsandastrophysics/tforsythe/) (Institut Laue-Langevin). As a graduate student, he worked on two enzyme systems: E. coli copper amine oxidase (ECAO) and aspartate α-decarboxylase (ADC). In case of ECAO, he explored the effect of two non active site mutations whereas in case of ADC, he studied the effect of binding of a ligand on structure and dynamics of these enzymes. For this, he used a combination of neutron spectroscopy, X-ray/neutron diffraction and molecular dynamics simulations.


In the Fraser lab, Tushar will work on the structural basis of translation stalling using single particle cryo-EM. He will create a predictive model for interactions between nascent peptide motifs, small molecules, and the ribosome."
