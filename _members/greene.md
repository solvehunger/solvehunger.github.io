description: "Eric is interested in understanding how protein conformations impact function and regulation, and, how posttranslational factors that occur throughout a protein’s lifetime further tune function. Eric graduated from the University of Colorado, Boulder with degrees in Biochemistry and Molecular, Cellular, and Development Biology. As an undergraduate, he worked with Dr. Zhongping Tan using chemical biology approaches to study glycosylated proteins. As a graduate student in [Dr. Andy Martin’s](http://mcb.berkeley.edu/labs/martin/) lab at UC Berkeley, Eric studied how conformations and conformational dynamics of the 26S proteasome influence degradation processes. He also collaborated with [Dr. Susan Marqusee’s](https://zebra.berkeley.edu) lab to help illuminate how energetic changes conferred by site-specific ubiquitination on substrate proteins influenced whether, and how, these proteins were degraded by the proteasome.


In the Fraser lab, Eric seeks to understand how protein conformational states influence activity and regulation of metabolic enzymes.


When not in the lab, Eric enjoys spending time at home with his cats, running, skiing, mountain biking, and cooking.


Eric is supported by a Kirschstein NRSA (F32) fellowship from [NIH/NIGMS](https://www.nigms.nih.gov/)."
