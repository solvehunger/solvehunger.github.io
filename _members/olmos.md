description: "Joey graduated from the University of Texas at Austin with a degree in Biochemistry. He received his Ph.D. in Biochemistry and Cell Biology from Rice University. As a graduate student with [Dr. George Phillips](http://www.phillipslab.org/), his thesis work involved method development of mix-and-inject serial crystallography for structural enzymology using X-ray free electron lasers (XFEL).


When he’s not in lab, Joey enjoys discovering new music, reading, and going on long walks around the city."
