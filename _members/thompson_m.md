description: "Mike's longstanding research interest lies in understanding how proteins function by dynamically interconverting between different conformational states. He was introduced to structural biology and X-ray crystallography as an undergraduate at UC Berkeley, where he was a research assistant in [Tom Alber](http://fraserlab.com/2014/04/04/Tom-Alber/)’s laboratory. In 2014, he received his Ph.D. in [Biochemistry and Molecular Biology](http://bmsb.chem.ucla.edu/) from UCLA under the direction of [Dr. Todd Yeates](http://yeateslab.mbi.ucla.edu/). As a graduate student, Mike investigated the role of conformational polymorphism in expanding the functional diversity of a key family of proteins that define a widespread class of prokaryotic organelles collectively known as “bacterial microcompartments.”


As a postdoc in the Fraser Lab, he is developing new methods that combine temperature perturbations with static and time-resolved structural measurements to provide detailed insight into the conformational landscapes of biological macromolecules. These new methods are being applied to understand how protein function is modulated by genetic mutations, by interactions with other molecules, and by other physical stimuli.


Since joining the Fraser lab in 2014, Mike has been supported by a postdoctoral fellowship from the [BioXFEL Science and Technology Center](http://www.bioxfel.org/) (NSF), a Kirschstein NRSA (F32) fellowship from [NIH/NHLBI](http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/), and an Independent Postdoctoral Research Award from the [UCSF Program in Breakthrough Biomedical Research (PBBR)](http://pbbr.ucsf.edu/)."
