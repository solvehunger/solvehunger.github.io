description: "Jenna graduated from Ursinus College with degrees in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology and in French. While an undergrad, she studied the structure-function relationships of diiron-carboxylate enzymes rubrerythrin and symerythrin using the de novo G4DFsc protein model system under the guidance of [Dr. Amanda Reig](https://www.ursinus.edu/live/profiles/76-amanda-reig).


In the Fraser lab, Jenna studies the interactions between streptogramin antibiotics and the ribosome.


When sheâ€™s not in the lab, Jenna enjoys climbing, reading, playing squash, and gaming.


Jenna is supported by a graduate fellowship from [NSF](http://www.nsfgrfp.org/)."
