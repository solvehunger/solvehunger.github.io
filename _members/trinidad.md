description: "Donovan graduated from CUNY John Jay College with a degree in Cell and Molecular Biology. As an undergraduate, he worked under [Dr. Nathan Lents](https://nathanlents.wordpress.com) to help develop a computational model that determined an individual's time of death based on changes in the cadaver's skin microbiome.


In collaboration with Dr. Willow Coyote-Maestas, he is studying the structure-function relationship of the ESX-3 secretion system in M. smegmatis.


Outside of lab, Donovan enjoys watching movies, gaming, reading, and listening to music. He promises he isn't ignoring you, he's just wearing headphones and they're hidden by his hair.


Donovan is supported by a Kirschstein NRSA (F31) fellowship from [NIH/NIGMS](https://www.nigms.nih.gov/)."
