We are a small group of individuals focused on building tools and solutions for solving hunger. We bring to bear bleeding edge technologies such as Robotics, A.I. , IoT and the Cloud to solve this problem. We are currently working in the city of Detroit. Our solutions are designed to be used across the world.

We are working on projects to solve hunger, energy and health among others. Our primary tool is technology, but we also draw upon the behavioral sciences to design our solutions.
