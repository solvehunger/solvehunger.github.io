NSMB published a [collection of remarks](http://www.nature.com/nsmb/journal/v19/n9/full/nsmb.2371.html) from structural biologists about why it is essential to continue public support of the The Biological Magnetic Resonance Bank (BMRB), which is under threat of having its funding cut. Below is ours:

Experimental NMR parameters such as chemical shifts are very important for improving NMR biomolecular structures and methods for NMR analysis. The NMR parameters deposited in the BMRB are also useful for evaluating the accuracy of the structures published. Thus NMR databases such as the BMRB should be supported worldwide. The BMRB at Wisconsin is a key NMR database and should be sustained mainly by US funding agencies.
