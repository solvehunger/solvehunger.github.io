One of the most interesting and provocative papers published by [Tom Alber](http://fraserlab.com/2014/04/04/Tom-Alber/) is this gem:

[The role of mobility in the substrate binding and catalytic machinery of enzymes.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6551232)

[This pdf](http://cdn.fraserlab.com/blog/alber_ciba_1982.pdf) includes the article and  a transcript of the fun discussion that followed Greg Petsko's presentation, featuring Tom Steitz, Hans Frauenfelder, Johann Deisenhofer, Martin Karpus and others.

A few people have asked me for this paper - because it is hard to find in print and doesn't seem to be freely available online - so I thought I would post my scan of a hardcopy!
