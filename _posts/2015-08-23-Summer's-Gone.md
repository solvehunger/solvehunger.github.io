almost... it's been a bit too long since we updated the website:

* Erin joined the lab!
* Lin came back from parental leave!
* Andrew completed the [Insight Data Science](http://insightdatascience.com/) program!
* Alex and Pooja rotated!
* Saul was a great SEP student!
* Jennifer did great lab work and updated the lab [cartoon](/members)!
* We published a bunch of [papers](/publications)!
* Joslyn got promoted and Eleanor took over our admin responsibilities!
* and we started planning for this year's version of [PUBS](/pubs)
