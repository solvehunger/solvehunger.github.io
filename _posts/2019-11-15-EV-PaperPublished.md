This paper has been a labor of love. When I started on it in 2017, EVs were considered a curiosity. Even my industry partner had little knowledge of the field. The saving grace was TESLA's open patents!! I poured over them and I think those patents must have some of my cornea melt on them :) Anyways, this has been a relief - I hope it helps more people to look at the EV supply chain.

## Abstract
Consumer demand for Electric Vehicles (EVs) is increasing due to improving performance and affordability. However, EV manufacturers are struggling to meet this rise in demand. A key bottleneck is supply from a nascent EV battery supply chain that is new and developing. 
In this paper, we propose robotic work cell design for fast and reliable assembly of EV battery modules, at scale, to reduce this demand-supply gap.
