Goodbye Rahel and Brandi!

Last Friday saw Rahel's thesis talk and a goodbye party at Spark for Brandi. Rahel moves down to Stanford as a postdoc, where she will be exploring the exciting developments in cryo electron tomography in [Wah Chiu's lab](https://profiles.stanford.edu/wah-chiu). Brandi will move to Boston to take a Scientist position at [Relay Therapeutics](http://relaytx.com/), a company focused on exploiting protein dynamics for drug discovery. Brandi was already pretty familiar with Relay as she had been collaborating with them since joining the lab in 2016!
