### Internship Logistics
Because of the global nature of our enterprise as well as the travel challenges related to the COVID-19, we have currently shifted to a fully remote execution model. The primary medium of collaboration is a set of digital collaboration platforms and tools. Teams working on specific projects meet at least once in a week. On an as needed basis we may meet physically in some cities including but not limited to, San Francisco, Ann Arbor, Detroit, London, New York, Paris, Munich, Bengaluru, and Delhi.

#### Selection Principles
We are looking for a few highly motivated, positive individuals.
We look at passion, commitment, humility, work ethic, a willingness to learn, positive orientation and alignment of values with our lab. Identities, including academic pedigree are not a consideration. If you are a late-bloomer who wants a second chance at pushing your limits, we will not hold that against you.

For most positions, we have more applicants than available positions. We may have initial round of tests and interviews depending upon the specific project and position. We encourage all prospective interns to apply for projects that they feel passionate about.

Because we have multiple projects being executed with different policies and timings for final lab decision making, we cannot make any commitments on assigning interns to their first choice projects. We give equal consideration to all applicants and attempt to accommodate the widest possible share of our applicant pool in our projects.

#### Internship Timeline
The initial induction of an intern will be for one month, with the option to continue based on contribution and work ethic. The goal here is to maintain project momentum and high octane fun environment for the benefit of the project and its team members. Team members who detract from these goals may be asked to leave, though such instances have been very rare.

During their first month, interns may be rotated through a variety of tasks prior to assigning them to a primary focus area. Interns are appointed to positions of higher responsibility based on their performance and work ethic. Our project leadership positions are usually open for rotation among students every quarter. We encourage students to keep talking to the PI and lab members about what kind of project they might want to shape. We consider project fit, work ethic, skills, and alignment with lab values. 

If positions open up for the core team in the lab, we will offer them first to our interns who have worked with us for over six months, before looking outside the lab.

#### Work Ethic
Our pace of work is fast and the learning curve steep. We want this to be a fun and high value learning experience for our interns.
Keeping this high energy and positive energy in the lab is something we take seriously as we believe that it ensures a fun , active and high learning environment for our interns. Here you can see what some of our intern alumni are doing right now.
