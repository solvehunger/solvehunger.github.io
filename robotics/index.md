# Focus: Improving the Human Condition
Our research in robotics is focused on the use of robots for improving the human condition. Some of the projects we have worked on include transforming the EV battery supply chain, food security, and survival supply chains.
We are open to suggestions on additional projects to take on. If there is a need you wish to fulfill using robots, you can write to us directly with a proposal. We are happy to collaborate with individuals and teams that are looking at robotics as a way to create a better future.

### Robotic Assembly of EV batteries

<div class="col-md-7 order-md-1">

As electric vehicle adoption accelerates and demand increases, the inability to produce batteries in sufficient quantities has emerged as a critical bottleneck in the electric vehicle supply chain.
Given the impending climate change crisis, resolving this bottleneck is imperative to accelerate the transition to a zero-emission electric mobility future.
One potential solution is the use of robotics for fast and cost-effective assembly of batteries at scale.
  In this project, we designed, simulated and validated a robotic system for assembling EV battery modules.
  Digital twin analytics was used to evaluate and optimize the proposed robotic battery assembly system for speed and cost.
Industrial automation experts were consulted to further improve robotic work cell layouts to minimize investment in robots.
Because digital twins of robotic workcells have been used, the configurations of the battery assembly line, as designed and validated, are ready for immediate implementation.
For practitioners, this project offers heuristic methods to determine the appropriate assembly line configuration, the required number of robots and humans, for a desired production volume.

### AI enabled Cobotic Inspection for Safer EV batteries

<div class="col-md-7 order-md-2">
High quality, safe and reliable batteries are critical for large-scale electrification of mobility. Current Li-ion battery pack manufacturing processes rely on manual inspections for ensuring electric vehicle (EV) battery quality. Such manual quality control is prone to yield defective batteries, increasing the chances of battery malfunction, raising safety and reliability concerns.
Furthermore, manual inspection is time consuming and likely to become a bottleneck in scaling up EV battery production.
A potential solution to address the need for fast and accurate quality inspection is to use machine vision and robotics.
In this project, we designed, simulated and validated a system which uses cobots and machine vision for inspecting EV batteries for defects.
The proposed cobotic system is simulated for different battery defects to achieve fast and reliable detection. Because a digital twin of the cobotic inspection workcell has been used, the battery inspection system as designed and validated, is ready for immediate implementation.

### Last mile distribution of food and essentials during pandemics

<div class="col-md-7 order-md-1 ">

The COVID-19 pandemic unraveled the weak points in the global supply chain for goods. Specifically, people all over the world, including those in the most advanced nations have had to go without medical supplies and personal protective equipment. Scarcity of essentials increases anxiety and uncertainty exacerbating unproductive behaviors like hoarding and price gouging. Left to market forces, such unfair practices are likely to aggravate hardships and increase the loss of lives. Thus, there is a critical need to ensure safe distribution of food and essential supplies to all citizens to sustain them through challenging times. To this end, we propose a simple, affordable and contact-less robotic system for preparing and dispensing food and survival-kits at community scale. The system has provisions to prevent hoarding and price  gouging. Design, simulation, and, validation of the system has been completed to ensure readiness for real world implementation. This project is part of an open-source program and detailed designs are available upon request to entities interested in using it to serve their communities.
